ATTENTION CADET!

YOU HAVE THE OH-SO HONORABLE JOB OF CLEARING OUT THE SPACE JUNK IN TRADING ROUTE 15-YB.
THE EGGHEADS DOWN IN ENGINEERING HAVE MADE THIS JOB A LOT NICER FOR YOU NEWBIES, THEY WIPPED UP A DRONE
THAT GOES OUT AND BLASTS AWAY THE DERELICT SHUTTLES OF SPACEWAYMEN THAT WE APREHENDED. IT USED TO BE A BUNCH OF NUMBERS
BUT THEY ADDED A GUI THAT USES A STANDARD MOUSE TO AIM THE DRONE AND SHOOT IT. IT'LL TAKE A FEW BLASTS TO DESTROY THE DERELICT SHUTTLES BUT A SMART COOKIE LIKE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT. DON'T FORGET THAT CLICKING THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON SHOOTS THE GUN, TOOK SMITHERS TWO HOURS TO FIGURE THAT OUT. GET TO IT CADET!
